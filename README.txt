* gem install cine-passion

== DEVELOPERS:

After checking out the source, run:

  $ rake newb

This task will install any missing dependencies, run the tests/specs,
and generate the RDoc.

* XML Sample files
To start devel on my project I made sample files. You can found them on test/data folder. At this time I have theres :
cinepassion-scraper-test-00-no-response.xml -> No response from scraper
cinepassion-scraper-test-01-one-response.xml -> One result from scraper
cinepassion-scraper-test-02-mutiple-response.xml -> Many result from scraper

In "exploded" directory, I have "translate" files in human readable format (only with indentation ;) ). Do not use there files.

* Demo mode
By default if you not create a lib/cine_passion_config.rb you are in demo mode :
- Query: "noresult" => Return cinepassion-scraper-test-00-no-response.xml
- Query: "Home" => Return cinepassion-scraper-test-01-one-response.xml
- Query: "The Men Who Stare At Goats" => Return cinepassion-scraper-test-02-mutiple-response.xml
- Other query => Random result of above
